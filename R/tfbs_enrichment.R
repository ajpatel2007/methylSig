#' Perform transcription factor enrichment test among differentially methylated cytosines or regions
#'
#' This function tests for enriched transcription binding sites among differentially methylated sites or regions using a binomial test.
#'
#' Likelihood ratio test is used based on the binomial distribution.
#'
#' @param myDiff \code{GRanges} object resulting from \code{methylSigCalc} that contains all CpG sites that are tested for differential methylation.
#' @param dmcList A \code{logical} of the same length as \code{myDiff} defining the DMCs or DMRs.
#' @param tfbsInfo A \code{GRanges} object of the genomic regions representing peaks. The \code{name} column should indicate which TF the peak is for.
#'
#' @return A \code{data.frame} whose \code{rownames} are inherited from the \code{name} column of the input BED file, and whose columns are:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{n_total_by_tf}{ The number of tested CpGs in a TFBS for a TF. }
#'   \item{n_dmc_by_tf}{ The number of DM CpGs in a TFBS for a TF. }
#'   \item{N_total}{ The total number of tested CpGs in a TFBS across all the TFs. }
#'   \item{N_dmc}{ The total number of DM CpGs in a TFBS across all the TFs. }
#'   \item{p_total}{ \code{n_total_by_tf} / \code{N_total}, used in the likelihood calculation. }
#'   \item{p_dmc}{ \code{n_dmc_by_tf} / \code{N_dmc}, used in the likelihood calculation. }
#'   \item{logLik}{ The log-likelihood based on the binomial distribution. }
#'   \item{pvalue}{ The p-value from the likelihood ratio test. }
