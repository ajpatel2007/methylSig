CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5.0
------------------------

    o NOTE: This version of methylSig only works for R <= 3.4.4 and Bioc <= 3.6
      A feature change in the bsseq Bioconductor package in Bioc >= 3.7 does not
      allow BSseq-class objects whose GRanges are not points, and this breaks
      the tiling functionality of methylSig.

NEW FEATURES

    o Annotations are now done with the annotatr Bioconductor package.

USER-LEVEL CHANGES

    o methylSig v0.5.0 reuses Bioconductor classes rather than the home-spun
      classes of earlier versions. This will improve maintainability greatly.

        o The methylSigReadData() function now is a wrapper for the
          bsseq::read.bismark() function, obviating the need to transform
          the input data in anyway. The output is a BSseq-class object.

            o As before, filtering for common SNPs (hg19 only), minCount,
              and maxCount are available. Destranding also remains.

        o The result of any of the tests for differential methylation are now
          GenomicRanges-class objects.

    o Built-in example data is now known as sample_data.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a mistake in methylSig.tfbsEnrichTest() that mistakenly referred
      referred to tfbsInfo parameter as tfbs.

REMOVED FEATURES

    o Removed plotting functions for retooling.
