\title{Differential methylation analysis using binomial model}
\usage{
binomialDiffCalc(meth, groups = c(Treatment = 1, Control = 0),
  min.per.group = c(3, 3))
}
\arguments{
\item{meth}{A \code{methylSigData-class} object to calculate differential methylation statistics. It can be obtained using \code{\link{methylSigReadData}}.}

\item{groups}{A vector of two numbers specify two groups to compare. See \code{treatment} argument of \code{\link{methylSigReadData}} function. Default is \code{c(Treatment=1,Control=0)}.}

\item{min.per.group}{A vector with two numbers that specify the minimum numbers of samples required to be qualify as defferentially methylation region. If it is a single number, both groups will use it as the minimum requried number of samples. Default is \code{c(3,3)}.}
}
\value{
A \code{methylSigDiff-class} object that contains the differential methylation statistics and chromosomal locations. \code{p.adjust} with \code{method="BH"} option is used for P-value correction.
}
\description{
This function calculates differential methylation statistics using a binomial-based approach. See `Warning' message below.
}
\details{
This function uses a binomial-based model to calculate differential methylation statistics. It is nearly identical to the \code{methylKit::calculateDiffMeth} function in the \code{methylKit} R package except that only the likelihood ratio test and \code{p.adjust()} with \code{method=``BH''} are used to calculate significance levels. It is significantly faster than \code{methylKit::calculateDiffMeth} function.
}
\section{Warning}{
 This function does not take into account the variability among samples in each group being compared.
